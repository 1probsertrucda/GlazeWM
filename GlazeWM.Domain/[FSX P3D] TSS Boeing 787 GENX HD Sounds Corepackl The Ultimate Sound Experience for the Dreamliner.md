The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also boasts some impressive features that enhance its performance and efficiency. The aircraft is made of mostly composite materials, which are lighter and stronger than traditional metals. This reduces the weight of the aircraft and increases its fuel efficiency. The aircraft also has a unique wing design, which allows it to fly faster and farther than other aircraft of its size. The wing has a high aspect ratio, which means that it is long and thin, reducing drag and increasing lift. The wing also has a variable camber, which means that it can change its shape during flight to optimize aerodynamics.
 
Another feature that sets the Boeing 787 Dreamliner apart from other aircraft is its hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) system. This system reduces the turbulence of the air flowing over the tail-fin and the horizontal stabilizer, which are located at the rear of the aircraft. By using a special suction system, the air is kept smooth and laminar, which reduces drag and noise. The HLFC system is one of the reasons why the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is one of the quietest aircraft in the skies.
